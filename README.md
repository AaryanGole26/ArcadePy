# ArcadePy

ArcadePy is an umbrella project that merges four classic Python-based arcade games into one repository. With a simple user interface, the `arcadepy.py` file allows you to choose from four exciting games: Slither, Pong, Hovering UFO, and Hangman. Each game offers unique mechanics and is built using Python, providing an entertaining and engaging experience right in your terminal or command line interface.

## Features

- **Slither**: A classic snake game where you control a snake to eat food and grow longer while avoiding hitting the walls or itself.
- **Pong**: The iconic pong game where you compete against a computer-controlled paddle to score points.
